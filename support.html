                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How do I use AI Photo Sorter?</h3>
                        <p>Simply grant the app permission to access your photo library, and it will automatically scan for duplicates and similar photos. You can then review the grouped photos and delete the ones you don't want to keep.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What permissions does the app need?</h3>
                        <p>The app requires Photo Library access to analyze and organize your photos. This is the only permission needed, and you can revoke it anytime in your iOS Settings.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Does the app work offline?</h3>
                        <p>Yes! All AI processing happens on your device, so no internet connection is required. Your photos are analyzed completely offline.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                    <h2>Privacy & Security</h2>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is my data safe?</h3>
                        <p>Absolutely. AI Photo Sorter processes everything on your device using Apple's Vision framework. No photos, data, or analytics are ever sent to any servers. We don't have servers because we don't need them.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can you see my photos?</h3>
                        <p>No. Your photos never leave your device. All analysis happens locally on your iPhone, and we have no way to access or view your photos.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do you use any third-party services?</h3>
                        <p>No. We don't use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. The app is completely standalone.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Photo Organization</h2>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How does the app find similar photos?</h3>
                        <p>AI Photo Sorter uses Apple's advanced Vision framework to analyze the visual content of your photos. It can identify duplicates, near-duplicates, and photos that are visually similar.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How are photos scored for quality?</h3>
                        <p>The app analyzes multiple factors including sharpness, exposure, composition, and other visual characteristics to determine photo quality. This helps you identify your best shots when you have similar photos.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I undo deletions?</h3>
                        <p>Yes! When you delete photos through the app, they're moved to your "Recently Deleted" album in the iOS Photos app, where they remain for 30 days. You can restore them anytime during that period.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How long does analysis take?</h3>
                        <p>Analysis time depends on the size of your photo library. The app uses on-device AI which is very fast, but larger libraries with thousands of photos may take a few minutes to complete the initial scan.</p>
