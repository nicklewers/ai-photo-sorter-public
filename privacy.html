                    <h2>Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
                    <p>AI Photo Sorter is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your photos are personal, and we've built our app to ensure they stay that way.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Data Collection and Processing</h2>
                    <p class="highlight"><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your photos or personal data.</strong></p>

                    <h3>What Happens On Your Device</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All AI processing occurs entirely on your device using Apple's Vision framework</li>
                        <li>Photo analysis, quality scoring, and similarity detection happen locally</li>
                        <li>No photos, image data, or analysis results are ever sent to our servers</li>
                        <li>No internet connection is required for the app to function</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>❌ Your photos or images</li>
                        <li>❌ Photo metadata (dates, locations, camera info)</li>
                        <li>❌ Face data or biometric information</li>
                        <li>❌ Personal information (name, email, etc.)</li>
                        <li>❌ Usage analytics or behavior tracking</li>
                        <li>❌ Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Permissions Required</h3>
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4>Photo Library Access (Required)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The app needs permission to read your photos for analysis</li>
                            <li>Write permission is required to delete photos you choose to remove</li>
                            <li>All access is handled through Apple's secure PhotoKit framework</li>
                            <li>You can revoke this permission anytime in iOS Settings</li>

                <section>
                    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
                    <p>No data from the app is stored on our servers because we don't have any servers. All processing happens on your device, and any temporary data used during analysis is stored only in your device's memory and automatically cleared when you close the app.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                    <p>Our app does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since all processing is on-device and we collect no data, the app is safe for users of all ages.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Changes to Photos</h2>
                    <p>The app can only delete photos with your explicit confirmation. When you delete photos through the app:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Photos are moved to your "Recently Deleted" album in iOS Photos</li>
                        <li>They remain recoverable for 30 days (standard iOS behavior)</li>
                        <li>You can restore them anytime within that period</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>International Users</h2>
                    <p>Since all processing happens on your device and no data leaves your device, there are no international data transfers or regional restrictions.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
                    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

                    <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
                    <p>This app complies with:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Since we collect no personal data, many privacy regulations do not apply, but we're committed to maintaining the highest privacy standards regardless.</p>
